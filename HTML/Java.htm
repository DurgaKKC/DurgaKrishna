            <h1>What is JAVA?</h1>
            <p>
              Java is a popular programming language used to create all kinds of
              software, from mobile apps to web applications. Itâ€™s known for
              being easy to use, reliable, and able to run on many different
              types of computers and devices without needing to be changed.
              Developers like Java because once they write the code, it can run
              on any machine that has the Java software installed
