            <h1>What is software testing?</h1>
            <p>
              Software testing is the process of checking if a computer program
              or app works the way itâ€™s supposed to. The goal is to find any
              mistakes (called "bugs") or problems before the software is
              released to users. Testers run the software, try different things,
              and see if it behaves correctly. <br> 
              There are two main types of software testing: <br> <br>
               1. Manual Testing: A person uses the software to
              check for problems. <br> <br>
               2. Automated Testing: Special programs are
              used to test the software automatically.
